There's a default project called 'Inbox' which you can add todos to. You can make new projects and add respective todos to them. Along with that you can delete todos and projects. One can also mark a todo as done.

For the storage, localStorage API has been used which you can see under 'Inspect Element -> Application -> Local Storage'.
